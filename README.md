# Gumball Machine - Lego NXT Group Design Project

=========================
The code was written in Robot C and implemented in our 1A Mechatronics group design project, where we were given free reign 
to make whatever we wanted using the given Lego Mindstorms Kit and various other materials. Our group created a gumball machine that was capable of sorting gumballs by colour and dispensing based on user input.
